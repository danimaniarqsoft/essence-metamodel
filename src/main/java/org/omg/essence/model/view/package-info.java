/**
 * View, contains elements to support the specification of view contents.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A user interacts through the realization of one or more views as he or she
 * works according to a kernel, practice, or method. The views provide a means
 * for users to interact with a relevant subset, and relevant details, of
 * Essence language constructs as they are used to describe a method instance.
 * The overall objective with the views is to be able to provide the right and
 * purposeful support for different types of users and at different points in
 * time; and as a consequence, help in avoiding information overflow of language
 * construct detail. This is because different types of users have different
 * needs or interests in the details of a method instance description. Some
 * users need very little details whereas others need more. For this purpose,
 * the Essence language introduces the ViewSelection construct to support the
 * specification of view contents
 *
